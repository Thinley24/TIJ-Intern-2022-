It can be a metaphor or simile designed to make a comparison. It can be the repetition of alliteration or the exaggeration of hyperbole to provide a dramatic effect. There are a wealth of these literary tools in the English language. Advertisement Examples of Figures of Speech Figures of speech lend themselves particularly well to literature and poetry. They also pack a punch in speeches and movie lines. Indeed, these tools abound in nearly every corner of life. Let's start with one of the more lyrical devices — alliteration. Alliteration Examples Alliteration is the repetition of the beginning sounds of neighboring words. Examples include: She sells seashells. Walter wondered where Winnie was. Blue baby bonnets bobbed through the bayou. Nick needed new notebooks. Fred fried frogs' legs on Friday. Anaphora Examples Anaphora is a technique where several phrases or verses begin with the same word or words. For example: \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\" - Julius Caesar \"Mad world! Mad kings! Mad composition!\" - King John II, William Shakespeare \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.\" - A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens \"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right.\" - Abraham Lincoln \"We shall not flag or fail.

For example: A little thin on top (instead of \"going bald\") Fell off the back of a truck (instead of \"stolen\") Letting you go (instead of \"firing you\") Passed away (instead of \"died\") Economical with the truth (instead of \"liar\") Hyperbole Examples Hyperbole uses exaggeration for emphasis or effect. Examples include: I've told you to stop a thousand times. That must have cost a billion dollars. I could do this forever. She's older than dirt. Everybody knows that. Irony Examples Irony occurs when there's a marked contrast between what is said and what is meant, or between appearance and reality.

(situational irony) We named our tiny Chihuahua \"Brutus.\" (verbal irony) The audience knows the killer is hiding in a closet in a scary movie, but the actors do not. (dramatic irony) Metaphor Examples A metaphor makes a comparison between two unlike things or ideas. Examples include: heart of stone time is money the world is a stage she's a night owl he's an ogre Onomatopoeia Examples Onomatopoeia is the term for a word that sounds like what it is describing. For examples: whoosh splat buzz click oink Advertisement Oxymoron Examples An oxymoron is two contradictory terms used together. Some examples include: peace force kosher ham jumbo shrimp sweet sorrow free market Personification Examples Personification gives human qualities to non-living things or ideas. Examples include: The flowers nodded. The snowflakes danced. The thunder grumbled. The fog crept in. The wind howled. Simile Examples A simile is a comparison between two unlike things using the words \"like\" or \"as.\" For example: as slippery as an eel like peas in a pod as blind as a bat eats like a pig as wise as an owl Synecdoche Examples Synecdoche occurs when a part is represented by the whole or, conversely, the whole is represented by the part. Examples include: wheels can represent a car the police can represent one policeman plastic can represent credit cards Coke can represent any cola drink hired hands present workers Understatement Examples An understatement occurs when something is said to make something appear less important or less serious. For example: It's just a scratch. (referring to a large dent) It's a little dry and sandy. (referring to the driest desert in the world) The weather is cooler today.
